1. No interface for adding pubs. Pubs are only added by Makimo, as is the first admin.
1a. Many admins in a pub permitted. An admin can't change his own role, but can change
    the role of other admins.
2. Registration. Each user needs an app, so registration only in an app ??

change role
sends admin the a page with a dropdown form

remove user
sends admin to the confirmation page

there will be two panels on those pages:
left, with info about user
right, with the form

they will be shared by three views -> include
